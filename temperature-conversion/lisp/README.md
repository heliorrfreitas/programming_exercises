# Temperature Converter Functions in Lisp

These are the functions to convert the temperature form Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. 

It was developed in Common Lisp. 

To test I loaded the script in the Lisp REPL, and called the functions with temperatures I knew the answer to. 

to load a file in the Common Lisp REPL use the command 

'(load "temperature-converter.lisp")
